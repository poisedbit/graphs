# Graphs, web app chart generator

Graphs —project name may undoubtedly be subject to change— is a fully client-side web application, with a simple and easy interface, that allows the user to automatically generate multiple charts based on any number of submited spreadsheets. You can upload a multitude of files from different formats at a time, select the desired charts or graphs for a single or multiple spreadsheets, and get results displayed. Additionally, you can export each chart, or all at once, to a desired format which can later be used in applications like document editors.

## The Goal

The goal, aside from everything mentioned above, is to deliver a capable, modern, precise, reliable, and performant web application for all kinds of users. One that can accurately draw all sorts of charts or graphs from a few clicks. All of this, while being open-source and free.

### Road To Feature-Complete

This is a work in progress. Later on I'm gonna be adding a to do list for every check mark that has to be ticked off so that we can arrive to a feature-complete state.
