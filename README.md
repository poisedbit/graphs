# Graphs, web app chart generator

Graphs —project name may undoubtedly be subject to change— is a fully client-side web application, with a simple and easy interface, that allows the user to automatically generate multiple charts based on any number of submited spreadsheets. You can upload a multitude of files from different formats at a time, select the desired charts or graphs for a single or multiple spreadsheets, and get results displayed. Aditionally, you can export every chart to a desired format for use in applications like document editors.

## The Goal

The goal, aside from everything mentioned above, is to deliver a capable, modern, precise, reliable, and performant web application for all kinds of users. One that can accurately draw all sorts of charts or graphs from a few clicks. All of this, while being open-source and free.

## Some questions

—No one has asked me these questions, though. Why? Because I have no friends.—

### Graphs or Charts?

I suppose no one cares but this' still an interesting topic to look at. This starts with the fact that my first language isn't english, but spanish, so when the idea for this project came up to me what I was always thinking was the spanish word "gráficas", which translated literally means "graphs". The interesting part comes with the difference between graphs and charts which both refer to different groups of diagrams, the former being a subkind of the latter. But in spanish, there's no literal translation for "charts", so both graphs and charts are known by the same word and are indistinguishable from each other —besides the context in a given conversation, or a more specific aspect like the mathematical relationships intrinsic of graphs—.
